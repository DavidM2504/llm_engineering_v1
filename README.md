# AI Engineer Core Track  
**LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA & Autonomous Agents**

This repository contains my learning work, experiments, and assignments completed while following the Udemy course  
**“AI Engineer Core Track: LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, Agents”** by Ed Donner.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in modern AI engineering concepts through hands-on implementation.

## 📌 What to Expect from This Repository

- Educational code and notebooks created during the course
- Assignments and mini-projects for each module
- Experiments with frontier and open-source LLMs
- RAG pipelines, fine-tuning workflows, and agent systems
- Iterative and exploratory code (not production-ready)

> ⚠️ This repository is intended for **learning purposes only**.

## 🗓 Course Overview (8-Week Track)

1. Build Your First LLM Product – Exploring Top Models  
2. Multi-Modal Chatbot – LLMs, Gradio UI & Agents  
3. Open-Source GenAI – Automated Solutions with Hugging Face  
4. LLM Evaluation – Code Generation & Business Tasks  
5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vector Embeddings  
6. Fine-Tuning Frontier LLMs with LoRA / QLoRA  
7. Competing with Frontier Models Using Fine-Tuned Open-Source LLMs  
8. Building Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems  

Each module includes lectures, practical implementations, and assignments, all of which are reflected in this repository.
